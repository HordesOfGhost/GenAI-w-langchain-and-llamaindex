The franchise also includes short films, a television series, toys, video games, live shows, and theme park attractions. The films are distributed by Universal Pictures.\\n\\nThe first film, based on the 1998 Vibe magazine article \"Racer X\" by Ken Li and written by Gary Scott Thompson, Erik Bergquist, and David Ayer, was released in 2001. It began the original tetralogy of films focused on illegal street racing, which culminated in the film Fast & Furious (2009). The series moved towards heists and spying with Fast Five (2011), which was followed by five sequels in that genre, the most recent of which, Fast X, was released on May 19, 2023.\\n\\nUniversal expanded the series to include the spin-off film Hobbs & Shaw (2019), while its subsidiary DreamWorks Animation followed this with the six-season animated streaming television series Fast & Furious Spy Racers (2019–2021). Soundtrack albums have been released for all the films, as well as compilation albums containing existing music heard in the films. Two short films that tie into the series have also been released.\\n\\nThe series has been commercially successful. It is Universal\\'s biggest franchise and the seventh highest-grossing film series, with a combined gross of over $7 billion.[2] Critical reception for the first four films was mixed until the fifth and later films, which were more positively received. Outside of the films, Fast & Furious has been the focus of other media, including attractions at Universal Studios Hollywood and Universal Studios Florida, live shows, commercials, toys, and video games.\\n\\nFilms [ edit ]\\n\\nReleased [ edit ]\\n\\nThe Fast and the Furious (2001) [ edit ]\\n\\nBrian O\\'Conner, an LAPD officer, goes undercover in the street racing world to investigate a group of unknown truck hijackers, believed to be led by Dominic Toretto.\\n\\n2 Fast 2 Furious (2003) [ edit ]\\n\\nBrian O\\'Conner and Roman Pearce team up to go undercover for the U.S. Customs Service to bring down drug lord Carter Verone in exchange for the erasure of their criminal records.\\n\\nThis is the only film in the main series without Vin Diesel as Dominic Toretto.\\n\\nThe Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift (2006) [ edit ]\\n\\nHigh school car enthusiast Sean Boswell is sent to live in Tokyo with his father and finds solace in the city\\'s drifting community.\\n\\nVin Diesel makes a cameo appearance as Dominic Toretto at the end of the film.\\n\\nFast & Furious (2009) [ edit ]\\n\\nDominic Toretto and Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) agent Brian O\\'Conner are forced to work together to avenge the murder of Toretto\\'s lover Letty Ortiz and apprehend drug lord Arturo Braga.\\n\\nThe film is set five years after the events of The Fast and the Furious, and before Tokyo Drift, with Sung Kang reprising his role as Han Lue from the latter film.[3]\\n\\nFast Five (2011) [ edit ]\\n\\nDom, Brian, along with Dom\\'s sister Mia plan a heist to steal $100 million from corrupt businessman Hernan Reyes while being pursued for arrest by U.S. Diplomatic Security Service (DSS) agent Luke Hobbs.\\n\\nThe film is also set before the events of Tokyo Drift. Despite not appearing in the film, a picture of Michelle Rodriguez as Letty Ortiz is seen in the mid-credits scene, where Eva Mendes reprises her role as Monica Fuentes from 2 Fast 2 Furious.\\n\\nFast & Furious 6 (2013) [ edit ]\\n\\nDominic Toretto, Brian O\\'Conner and their team are offered amnesty for their crimes by Luke Hobbs, in exchange for helping him take down a skilled mercenary organization led by Owen Shaw, one member of which is Toretto\\'s former lover Letty Ortiz.\\n\\nThe film is the final film to be set before the events of Tokyo Drift. Jason Statham appears as Owen\\'s older brother Deckard Shaw in the credits scene, seemingly killing Han, as seen in Tokyo Drift.\\n\\nFurious 7 (2015) [ edit ]\\nSource: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fast_%26_Furious\\n\\nContent: Nothing quite gets your adrenaline pumping like the \"Fast and Furious\" franchise.

One of the mercenaries appears to be Toretto\\'s presumed deceased lover, Ortiz.\\n\\nThis is the final film in the timeline before \"Tokyo Drift.\"\\n\\n\"Furious 7\"\\n\\nIn this 2015 release, Toretto, O\\'Conner, and the rest of the team return to normal lives after securing amnesty for their crimes. That is until Deckard Shaw (Jason Statham), a rogue assassin, comes seeking to avenge his younger brother.\\n\\nThe film is set after \"Fast & Furious 6\" and continues from the end of \"Tokyo Drift.\" It also marked the last appearance of Brian O\\'Conner played by Paul Walker, who died in 2013.\\n\\n\"The Fate of the Furious\"\\n\\nThe installment, released in 2017, starts with Toretto and Ortiz settling down to a calmer life than one of crime and racing cars.

The crew must then get together to find Toretto and stop Cipher.\\n\\n\"F9\"\\n\\nThe \"Fast and Furious\" release from 2021 sees Toretto and family coming together to foil a world-shattering plot headed by Cipher and Toretto\\'s estranged younger brother Jakob (John Cena).\\nSource: https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/movies/2022/07/29/fast-and-furious-movies-order-of-release/10062943002/\\n=========\\nFINAL ANSWER: The latest \"Fast and Furious\" movie is \"Fast X,\" released on May 19, 2023.\\nSOURCES:\\n\\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fast_%26_Furious\\nhttps://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/movies/2022/07/29/fast-and-furious-movies-order-of-release/10062943002/'}\n"
