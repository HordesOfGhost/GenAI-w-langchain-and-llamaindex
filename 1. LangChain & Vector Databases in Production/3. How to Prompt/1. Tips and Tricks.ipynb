It replaced Newton's law of universal gravitation and revolutionized our understanding of space, time, and gravity. According to general relativity, massive objects cause a distortion in spacetime, which is felt as gravity. This distortion is described by the metric tensor, a mathematical object that encapsulates the geometry of spacetime. The theory also predicts phenomena like gravitational waves, which were first detected in 2016. General relativity has been confirmed by numerous experiments and observations, and it is now a cornerstone of modern physics.\n"
